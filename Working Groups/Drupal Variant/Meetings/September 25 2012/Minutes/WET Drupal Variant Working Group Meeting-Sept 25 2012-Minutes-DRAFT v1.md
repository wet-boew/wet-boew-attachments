### Minutes

1. Meet and Greet
2. Terms of Reference
  - **Role of the working group**
    - *ACTION:* The working group needs a prioritized list of what is to be done.
      - (Andrew Sinkinson & Stephen Russett will put together the draft document in a couple of weeks and share with group for comments)
    - Role and responsibilities of the members were discussed and will be further discussed on Github
    - There was some discussion on how to retain the membership in the working group:
      - *SUGGESTION:* You don’t have to be a developer... you can contribute all sorts of ways, such as testing, documentation, screen casts on how to do things, etc. Most groups are doing this anyway.
      - *QUESTION:* Any other CMS considered (for Fed platform?)? Yes, Drupal and Interwoven. In 2002, Public Works supported Interwoven. However, as part of the Tiger Teams at Feds, in accessibility point of view Drupal more suited to one government of Canada website. RCMP did a comparison analysis of CMS, and Drupal was heads/shoulders above the rest.
      - *ACTION:* RCMP to share the their comparison on Gibhub wiki.
  - **Role and responsibilities of the members**
3. Progress made
  - **Demo of the Drupal Distro**
    1. Presentation of Drupal – Will thanks numerous contributors
    2. HTML 5 – Meta tags
    3. Layout – flexible templates – ensures gov’t approved look/feel
    4. Widgets – Tabbed Interface (panopoly templates)
    5. Apps – example – CTA (active disclosure app). Populus (Panopoly apps). Central location to SSC, apps will work with any department.
    6. Wet Themes – Allows Intranet “theme”, seasonal “theme”
    7. Entity Revision Scheduler (being considered)... most of the deployment errors experienced by some contributors, was directly related to this.
    8. Virtualized development environment. Suggests VirtualBox, Vagrant and Chef using Ariadne open source project on GitHub. Means that each developer would get the same “stack” from Dev to QA to Prod.
4. Discussion
  - **Next steps** (Active + upcoming projects)
    - Health Canada:
    
    Louis - Demo a proof of concept for internet. Lots of decentralized publishing, but trying to get into one site. Using WET for more community interaction. We have a couple of Web content management systems (Lotus Notes). Looking to implement Drupal in their “intranet” and network.
    - Canadian Transportation Agency:
    
    Outline that new features are to be built as an APP (reusable module) that they can then share with everyone else. If they have a bit more money in the SOW and they can get an app out of it that is then sharable within Drupal Community, they feel it is a win/win. Example side by side Editor. University of Ottawa is working on it, but so is Canadian Transportation Agency. This type of thing should be on the Wiki or the Issue Queue.
  - **Collaboration model**
    - Collaboration between Municipal, Provincial, Fed, etc... to improve service to citizens. Will be further discussed on Github and future meetings.
  - **Who is not at the meeting?**
    - No names were brought up
5. Next meeting and wrap up
  - **ACTION:**
    - Regular meetings for developers in Drupal. Establish a 1-day/month session.
    - Next Meeting of the Working Group: End of October 2012

#### Questions

1. Do you think a code freeze, and then release 1.0, 1.1 etc...? Yes, but won’t happen until the translations are completed.
2. What is the roadmap? Project roadmap? Development roadmap? (Maybe use the featured called “status” of all projects as a means to get the roadmap? This is being worked on by Andrew and Stephen
3. What is the framework for Internalization? Entity? Nodes? Merlin’s thing? Workbench is off, etc.
4. What is lifespan of Drupal 7 (time in between each release)? At least 3-4 years..... When Drupal 9 is released, Drupal 7 will cease, but Drupal 8 will be operational still
5. Any other CMS considered (for Fed platform?)? Yes, Drupal and Interwoven. In 2002, Public Works supported Interwoven... However, as part of the Tiger Teams at Feds, in accessibility point of view Drupal more suited to one govn’t of Canada website.	RCMP did a comparison analysis of CMS, and Drupal was heads/shoulders above the rest.
6. Is there going to be a separate github for Apps...?
7. What will be the priority (language, workflow)??

#### Action Items

1. Establish a wiki page listing high-level functionality of what the Drupal top priorities being worked-on. However, wikis work better for implementers, and GitHub for developers.
2. The working group needs a prioritized list of what is to be done. (Andrew & Stephen will put together the document in a couple of weeks.)
3. Open a discussion on githup on “virtual box”
4. Some Criteria should be defined for the list to decide what “should” and “shouldn’t” be there.
5. Adding some content to Meta issues and put them on github. (Stephen)
6. Circulate justification for github (Andrew)

#### Suggestions

1. Every item on the priority list list should be connected to a ticket, then if you want to work on an issue you just open a ticket and work on it; this way everybody knows what is done and others can collaborate.
2. Sub grouping is a good idea that things will be done faster. The each group will be assigned to work on one item.
3. It’s good to have a spreadsheet showing top features, status, expected delivery, etc.
4. Meta issues on GitHub get linked back to Documentation in Wiki.
